## The "I" Word

Consider this farmyard example:

    var cow = {
      makeSound: function () {
        return "moo";
      }
    };

    var bessie = Object.create(cow);

    bessie.makeSound()
      //=> 'moo'


Most JavaScript programmers would say that the object `bessie` *inherited* the `makeSound` method from its prototype `cow`. Whereas, if you flip through the pages of this book, we say that `bessie` *delegates* `makeSound` to `cow`. Either way, `cow` is a metaobject that describes how bessie handles making a sound.

But is there any reason not to use the word "inherits?" Are we being iconoclastic for no good reason?

Let's be pragmatic: The right word to use in conversation or documentation is the word that conveys your meaning accurately to the audience. In a document describing a piece of software, introducing an unfamiliar word  and having to explain what that word means is only beneficial if the result is that the reader has a greater understanding of that particular piece of software.

But when describing programming *concepts*, new words are beneficial if they lead to greater insights about programming. Thus, we may use the word "inheritance" all of the time when talking about programs, but sometimes use "inheritance" and sometimes use "delegation" when talking about programming.

And we're talking about programming. So let's figure out what we mean when we say "inherits from," and what we mean when we say "delegates to."

### a broken metaphor

We've discussed two different ways that we can have an object like `bessie` obtain its behaviour from an object like `cow`. First, it can copy cow's behaviour:

    var cow = {
      makeSound: function () {
        return "moo";
      }
    };

    var bessie = extend({}, cow);

Second, it can delegate its handling to cow:

    var bessie = Object.create(cow);

"Inheritance" is a word with a very specific meaning in the natural world. We say with confidence that children inherit physical traits from their parents. We now think that children inherit a lot of their behaviour from their parents as well. So, is "inheritance" copying? Or is it delegation?

I>At its most fundamental level, inheritance in organisms occurs by passing discrete heritable units, called genes, from parents to progeny.
I>
I>--[Features of Inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics#Features_of_inheritance)

In living creatures, inheritance is 100% copying. My son Thomas is tall. Both his mother and I are tall. We have copied parts of our programs--DNA--into his DNA, and thus he is tall. That copying occurred at conception, and thereafter my height has no effect on his height.

As I age, I am actually growing shorter, but he does not grow shorter. Likewise, although my hair turns silver, his hair remains brown. We maintain a social bond, but purely physical traits like height and hair colour are now independent. This is exactly how the [temnplates](#templates) work: Behaviour is shared from one object to another with copying, and thereafter changes to one object cannot affect the other object.

This is not how delegation through [prototyping](#trees) work at all. If you change a prototype, the behaviour of all objects "inheriting" from it is changed instantly. For example:

    var cow = {};

    var bessie = Object.create(cow);

    cow.makeSound = function () { return "mooooooooooooo!"; }

    bessie.makeSound()
      //=> 'mooooooooooooo!'

We can give cow behaviour *after* bessie is associated with cow, and bessie still gets that behaviour. Delegation through prototypes is dynamic. Inheritance in the real world is done with copying, but inheritance as most people describe it in programming is actually done through delegation.

### a word we've been saving for just the proper occasion

Let's take a closer look at the word **delegation**:[^]

I> Most commonly, \[delegation\] refers to a programming language feature making use of the method lookup rules for dispatching so-called self-calls as defined by Lieberman in his 1986 paper "Using Prototypical Objects to Implement Shared Behavior in Object-Oriented Systems". Delegation as a language feature supports the prototype-based programming model.

If I say that "I'm delegating all questions about my finances to my accountant," I am not saying that my accountant is my mother and that my genes include a copy of her genetic talent for toting up columns of figures.

When I say "I'm delegating all questions about my finances to my accountant," I'm saying that at the moment you ask me a question, I pass the question on to my accountant, who answers the question in the context of my finances. The word "delegation" implies several things:

1. The behaviour for one entity, the delegator, is handled by another entity, the delegate.
2. The delegator delegates handling the behaviour to the delegate at the time the behaviour is needed.
3. Messages are handled in the context of the delegator, not the delegate.

The third point is important: If the Canada Revenue Agency demands my annual income and I delegate that question to my accountant, the answer that comes back is going to be my annual income, not my accountant's annual income.[^forward]

[^forward]: A similar, yet different relationship is called "forwarding:" If I forward questions about my old koi pond to the people who bought the house and pond from me, they are going to answer the questions in their own context, not mine. Objects that forward behaviour to other objects relinquish the context.

*Delegation* is the correct term for the relationship between an object's behaviour and its prototype's behaviour. An object doesn't inherit behaviour from a prototype, it delegates behaviour *to* a prototype. And that prototype may in turn delegate to its prototype, and so forth along a prototype chain, with each object passing the context along.

### is-a

So we keep talking about "copying behaviour" and "delegating behaviour." It isn't really surprising that words like "delegation" are more accurate than "inheritance" when discussing behaviour, because "inheritance" as a word implies something only partly related to behaviour.

In object-oriented programming, "inheritance" describes an *is-a* relationship. When we say that `bessie` inherits from `cow`, we are also saying that `bessie is-a cow`. It's not just that bessie sounds like other cows, it's that bessie will pass any test we write for "being a cow."

Specifically, "if there's any piece of code that operates on cows, it can operate on bessie." What does that mean? Well, we need a couple of things:

1. An object (like `bessie`)
2. A set of things (like "cows")
3. A declaration that the object is-a member of the set
4. A function that interacts with our object.
5. There is some sense in which the function's invocations is valid, and some sense in which it is invalid. We could be talking about running without raising some sort of exception condition, or we could be talking about the world being in a valid state at the beginning and the end of the invocation. But no matter what, we have some way of measuring whether the function's operation is valid.

So our things are `object`, `set`, `is-a`, `function`, `validity-of-invocation`.

Now what does this have to do with cows? Ah, yes. It is possible to take a function and say, "This function is valid for all cows," meaning, "validity equals true for all x where x is a member of the set of all cows." Or in simpler terms, `f(x)` is valid for all `x` where `x is-a cow`.

That, believe-it-or-not, is the basis for all of the things people say about classes, [typing], [subtyping], interfaces,  [behavioural subtyping], design-by-contract... All of these ideas connect back to the concept of being able to look at a function and say that it operates on objects, and the function will always be valid when it operates on a certain kind of object.

[typing]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)
[subtyping]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtype
[behavioural subtyping]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle

The "problem" with JavaScript in this regard is that while it seems to make this kind of programming possible, it lacks any kind of rigorous application of the principle. In other languages, you can write something like:

    function milkTheCow (cow c) {
      // ...
    }

And there will be a check to ensure that if you ever write `milkTheCow(bessie)`, that in fact `bessie is-a cow`. Or that the function doesn't enter an invalid state even if bessie *is* a cow. For that matter, there's no built-in way of talking about valid and invalid states of the program.

JavaScript isn't built around "is-a," it's built around [ad hoc polymorphism], the idea that anything goes anywhere, and if you want to make sure that a certain function is valid for every possible cow, you write tests to ensure it works the way you expect it to work.

[ad hoc polymorphism]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc_polymorphism

JavaScript does provide some primitives, like `instanceof` and `.isPrototypeOf`, for testing various relationships, but if we want to build up some kind of notion of expressing a true is-a relationship, we'll need to build it ourselves.

### was-a

So if prototypes aren't "is-a," what are they? There is a term for the relationship between an object and its prototype, and the term is "was-a." What does that mean? Here's an example:

I buy a vintage Volkswagen Beetle. I customize it with racks:

![Cargo Bug](images/bug.jpg)[^bug]

My cargo bug is-a beetle. It's recognizable as a beetle. And everywhere I could use a beetle, I can use my cargo bug. This is the is-a relationship of programming, there is some set of functions, and they we are saying that they are valid for all "b" where "b is-a beetle." My cargo bug is a beetle, so we know that our functions are valid when they operate on it.

Now I buy another beetle, but I rip off the bodywork and build a completely different car out of it, a Dune Buggy:

![Dube Buggy](images/buggy.jpg)[^dunebuggy]

A dune buggy is not a beetle. It doesn't look like a beetle. It *was* a beetle, but now it's a dune buggy. "was-a" is a relationship that describes one object using another object for its implementation, but there is no equivalence implied. "was-a" is a relationship of convenience.

Returning to our cow, we might decide to
