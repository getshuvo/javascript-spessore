Writing is a journey, not a destination. This sample documents the direction we're facing as we take the next step.

This sample "document" is provided to illustrate direction [JavaScript Spessore][j(oop)s] is taking. **It is not held out to contain any of the actual book's content.** "Purchases" are being offered to people whose primary motivation is to support the book and encourage me to get it done.

Your purchase does include the right to download any and all versions of the book, as per Leanpub's lean publishing model. You will never be asked to pay more. You have the right to a 100% no-questions-asked refund if you are not satisfied with the progress of the book:

> Within 45 days of purchase you can get a 100% refund on any Leanpub purchase, in two clicks. We process the refunds manually, so they may take a few days to show up. [See full terms](https://leanpub.com/terms#returns).

> If you buy a Leanpub book you get all the updates to the book for free! All books are available in PDF, EPUB (for iPad) and MOBI (for Kindle). There is no DRM. There is no risk, just guaranteed happiness or your money back.

That being said, writing like this cannot be rushed: progress may be slow relative to a "Learn JavaScript OO in 21 Days" type of book. If you would prefer that there be a substantial amount of work completed, please be patient and check back in a month or so.

Please also bear in mind that pricing and bundling may vary over time. The book may be offered at any price in the future or even be free to read or free to share at some point in the future.
