## Class Hierarchies

*In theory*, JavaScript does not have classes. It has "prototypes," and it is always entertaining to lurk in a programming forum and watch peopel debate the exact definition of the word "class" in computer science, and then debate whether JavaScript has them. We've been careful to use the word "metaobject" in this book, mostly because "metaobject" isn't encumbered with baggage such as the `instanceof` keyword or specific rules about inheritance and creation of instances.

*In practice*, the following snippet of code is widely considered to be an example of a "class" in JavaScript:

    function Account () {
      this._currentBalance = 0;
    }

    Account.prototype.balance = function () {
      return this._currentBalance;
    }

    Account.prototype.deposit = function (howMuch) {
      this._currentBalance = this._currentBalance + howMuch;
      return this;
    }

    // ...

    var account = new Account();

The pattern can be extended to provide the notion of subclassing:

    function ChequingAccount () {
      Account.call(this);
    }

    ChequingAccount.prototype = Object.create(Account.prototype);

    ChequingAccount.prototype.sufficientFunds = function (cheque) {
      return this._currentBalance >= cheque.amount();
    }

    ChequingAccount.prototype.process = function (cheque) {
      this._currentBalance = this._currentBalance - cheque.amount();
      return this;
    }

We've been calling this pattern "Delegating to Prototypes," but let's call them classes and subclasses so that we can align our investiagtion with popular literature. These "classes and subclasses" provide most of the features of classes we find in languages like [Smalltalk]:

[Smalltalk]: http://www.squeak.org

* Classes are responsible for creating objects and initializing them with properties (like the current balance);
* Classes are responsible for and "own" methods, Objects delegate method handling to their classes (and superclasses);
* Methods directly manipulate an object's properties.

Smalltalk was, of course, [invented forty years ago][sthistory]. In those forty years, we've learned a lot about what works and what doesn't work in object-oriented programming. Unfortunately, this pattern celebrates the things that don't work, and glosses over or omits the things that work.

### the semantic problem with hierarchies

At a semantic level, classes are the building blocks of an [ontology]. This is often formalized in a diagram:

[ontology]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)

![An ontology of accounts](images/8/tree.png)

The idea behind class-based OO is to classify (note the word) our knowledge about objects into a tree. At the top is the most general knowledge about all objects, and as we travel down the tree, we get more and more specific knowledge about specific classes of objects, e.g. objects representing Visa Debit accounts.

Only, the real world doesn't work that way. It *really* doesn't work that way. In [morphology], for example, we have penguins, birds that swim. And the bat, a mammal that flies. And [monotremes] like the platypus, an animal that lays eggs but nurses its young with milk.

[monotremes]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotreme
[morphology]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)

It turns out that our knowledge of the behaviour of non-trivial domains (like morphology or banking) does not classify into a nice tree, it forms a directed acyclic graph. Or if we are to stay in the metaphor, it's a thicket.

Furthermore, the idea of building software on top of a tree-shaped ontology would be suspect even if our knowledge fit neatly into a tree. **Ontologies are not used to build the real world, they are used to describe it from observation**. As we learn more, we are constantly updating our ontology, sometimes moving everything around.

In software, this is incredibly destructive: Moving everything around breaks everything. In the real world, the humble Platypus does not care if we rearrange the ontology, because we didn't use the ontology to build Australia, just to describe what we found there. If we started by thinking that Platypus must be a flightless Avian, then later decide that it is a [monotreme], we aren't distrurbing any platypi at all with our rearranging the ontology. Whereas with classes and subclasses, if we rearrange our hierarchy, we are going to have to break and then mend our existing code.

[monotreme]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotreme

It's sensible to build an ontology from observation of things like bank accounts. That kind of ontology is useful for writing requirements, use cases, tests, and so on. But that doesn't mean that it's useful for writing the code that *implements* bank accounts.

Class Hierarchies are often the wrong semantic model, and the wisdom of forty years of experience with them is that there are better ways to compose programs.

### how does encapsulation help?

As we've discussed repeatedly, na√Øve classes suffer from [open recursion][or]. An enrmous amount of coupling takes place between classes in a class hierarchy when each class has full access to an object's properties through the `this` keyword. In [Encapsulation for MetaObjects](#encapsulation-for-metaobjects), we looked at one possible way to isolate classes from each other, reducing the amount of coupling.

If coupling is dramatically reduced throgh the use of techniques like encapsulation, we can look at a class hierarchy strictly as an excercise in getting the semantics correct.
