## Well, Actually...

Both inheritance and mixins have their place for both our domain classes and the metaobjects that define them. However, if not designed with care, object-oriented code bases evolve over time to become brittle and coupled whether they're built with inheritance or mixins. Let's take another look at class mixins and see why.

In [Class Mixins](#class-mixins), we saw how we could build two mixins, `Fluentize` and `Singletonize`. Implementing these two semantics as mixins allows us to create classes that have neither semantic, fluent semantics, singleton prototype semantics, or both. This is far less brittle than trying to do the same thing by cramming both sets of functionality into every class (the "heavyweight base" approach) or trying to set up an artificial inheritance hierarchy.

This sounds great for classes of classes and for our domains as well: Build classes for domain objects, and write mixins for various bits of shared functionality. Close the book, we're done!

Alas, we're not done. The flexibility of mixins is an illusion, and by examining the hidden problem, we'll gain a deeper understanding of how to design object-oriented software.

### self-binding-ization

In our next example, `Fluentize` overrides the `defineMethod` method, such that fluent classes use its implementation and not the implementation built into `MetaClass`. Likewise, `Singletonize` overrides the `create` method, such that singleton prototype classes use its implementation and not the implementation built into `MetaClass`.

These two mixins affect completely different methods, and furthermore the changes they make do not affect each other in any way. But this isn't always the case, consider this counter:

    var Counter = Class.create();

    Counter
      .defineMethod('initialize', function () { this._count = 0; })
      .defineMethod('increment', function () { ++this._count; })
      .defineMethod('count', function () { return this.count; });

    var c = Counter.create();

And we have some function written in continuation-passing-style:

    function log (message, callback) {
      console.log(message);
      return callback();
    }

Alas, we can't use our counter:

    log("doesn't work", c.increment);

The trouble is that the expression `c.increment` returns the body of the method, but when it is invoked using `callback()`, the original context of `c` has been lost. The usual solution is to write:

    log("works", c.increment.bind(c));

The `.bind` method binds the context permanently. Another solution is to write (or use a [function][_bind] to write):

[_bind]: http://underscorejs.org/#bind

    c.increment = c.increment.bind(c);

Then you can write:

    log("works without thinking about it", c.increment);

It seems like a lot of trouble to be writing this out everywhere, *especially* when the desired behaviour is nearly always that methods be bound. Let's write another mixin:

    function SelfBindingize (klass) {
      klass.defineMethod = function (name, body) {
        Object.defineProperty(this.prototype, name, {
          get: function () {
            return body.bind(this);
          }
        });
        return this;
      }
    }

    var SelfBindingCounter = Class.create();
    SelfBindingize(SelfBindingCounter);

    SelfBindingCounter.defineMethod('initialize', function () { this._count = 0; })
    SelfBindingCounter.defineMethod('increment', function () { return ++this._count; })
    SelfBindingCounter.defineMethod('count', function () { return this.count; });

    var cc = SelfBindingCounter.create();

    function log (message, callback) {
      console.log(message);
      return callback();
    }

    log("works without thinking about it", cc.increment);

Classes that mix `SelfBindingize` in are  self-binding. We've encapsulated the internal representation and implementation, and hidden it behind a method that we mix into the class.

### composition

As we might expect, `SelfBindingize` plays nicely with `Singletonize`, just as `Fluentize` did. But speaking of `Fluentize`, `Singletonize` does **not** play nicely with `Fluentize`. They both create new versions of `defineMethod`, and if you try to use both, only the last one executed will take effect.

The problem is that `SelfBindingize` and `Fluentize` don't *compose*. We can make up lots more similar examples too. In fact, metaprogramming tools generally *don't* compose when you write them individually. And this lesson is not restricted to "advanced" ideas like writing class mixins: Mixins in the problem domain have the same problem, they tend *not* to compose by default, and that makes using them a finicky and fragile process.

The naïve way to solve this problem is to write our mixins, and then when conflicts are discovered, rewrite them to play well together. This is not a bad strategy, in fact it might be considered the "optimistic" strategy. As long as we are aware of the possibility of conflicts and know to look for them when the code does not do what we expect, it is not unreasonable to try to avoid conflicts rather than investing in another layer of abstraction up front.

On the other hand, if we expect to be doing a lot of mixing in, it is a good investment to design around composition up front rather than deal with the uncertainty of not knowing when what appears to be a small change might lead to a lot of rewriting later on.

When dealing with semantics "in the large," such as when writing class mixins, there generally aren't a lot of "custom" semantics needed in one software application, and they generally come up early in the design and development process. Thus, many developers take the optimistic approach: They build classes and incorporate custom semantics as they go, resolving any conflicts where needed.

However, in the real of the problem domain, there are many more requirements for mixing functionality in, and requirements change more often. Thus, experienced programmers will sometimes build (or "borrow" from a library) infrastructure to make it easy to compose mixed-in functionality for domain objects.

For example, in the [Ruby on Rails] framework, there is extensive support for binding behaviour to controller methods and to model object lifecycles, and the library is carefully written so that you can bind more than one quantum of behaviour, and the bindings compose neatly without overwriting each others' effects.

[Ruby on Rails]: https://github.com/gititboards/RubyOnRails

This support is implemented with metaprogramming of the semantics of controller and model base classes. If we accept the notion that we are more likely to need to compose model behaviour than metaobject behaviour, one way forward is to use our tools for metaobject programming to implement a protocol for composing model behaviour.

### method decorators

When looking at writing classes with classes, we used the example of making methods [fluent by default](#fluentclass). Fluent APIs are a wide-ranging, cross-cutting concern the can be applied to many designs. But for every wide-ranging design technique, there are thousands of application-specific domain concerns that can be applied to method semantics.

Depending on the problem domain, programmers might be concerned about things like:

- Checking for permissions before executing a method
- Logging the invocation and/or result of a method
- Checking entities for validity before persisting them to storage.

Each domain concern can be written as a mixin of sorts. In [javaScript Allongé][ja], we looked at techniques for using combinators to apply special semantics to methods. For example, here is a simple combinator that "validates" the arguments to a method:

[ja]: https://leanpub.com/javascriptallongesix

    function validates (methodBody) {
      return function () {
        var i;

        for (i = 0; i < arguments.length; ++i) {
          if (typeof(arguments[i].validate) === 'function' && !arguments[i].validate()) throw "validation failure";
        }
        return fn.apply(this, arguments);
      }
    }

Amongst other improvements, a more robust implementation would mimic the method body's arity. But this is close enough for discussion: Applied to a function, it returns a function that first checks all of its arguments. If any of them implement a `.validate` method, that method is called and an error thrown if it doesn't return `true`.

And here's a combinator that implements "always fluent" method semantics (this differs slightly from the "fluent-by-default" that we saw earlier):

    function fluent (methodBody) {
      return function () {
        methodBody.apply(this, arguments);
        return this
      }
    }

These two combinators compose nicely if you write something like this:

    function Account () {
      // ...
    }

    Account.prototype.validate = function () {
      // ...
    };

    function AccountList () {
      this.accounts = [];
    }

    AccountList.prototype.add = fluent( validates( function (account) {
      this.accounts.push(account);
    }));

You can even explicitly compose the combinators:

    var compose = require('allong').es.compose;

    var fluentlyValidates = compose(fluent, validates);

Or apply them after assigning the method:

    AccountList.prototype.add = function (account) {
      this.accounts.push(account);
    };

    // ...

    AccountList.prototype.add = fluent( validates( AccountList.prototype.add ) );

Everything seems wonderful with this approach! But this has limitations as well. The limitation is that combinators operate on functions. The hidden assumption is that when we apply the combinator, we already have a function we want to decorate. This won't work, for example:

    function AccountList () {
      this.accounts = [];
    }

    AccountList.prototype.add = fluent( validates( AccountList.prototype.add ) );

    // ...

    AccountList.prototype.add = function (account) {
      this.accounts.push(account);
    };

You can't decorate the method's function before you assign it! Here's another variation of the same problem:

    function AccountList () {
      this.accounts = [];
    }

    AccountList.prototype.add = fluent( validates( function (account) {
      this.accounts.push(account);
    }));

    // ...

So far so good, but:

    function IndexedAccountList () {
      this.accounts = {};
    }

    IndexedAccountList.prototype = Object.create(AccountList.prototype);

    IndexedAccountList.prototype.add = function (account) {
      this.accounts[account.id] = account;
    }

    IndexedAccountList.prototype.at = function (id) {
      return this.accounts[id];
    }

Our `IndexedAccountList.prototype.add` overrides `AccountList.prototype.add`... And in the process, overrides the modifications made by `fluent` and `validates`. This makes perfect sense if you are using prototypical inheritance purely as a convenience for sharing some behaviour. But if you are actually trying to model a formal class, then perhaps you always want the `.add` method to validate its arguments and fluently return the receiver. Perhaps you only want to override how the method adds things internally without modifying the "contract" you are expressing with the outside world?

Regardless of your exact interpretation of the semantics of overriding a method that you've decorated, the larger issue remains that there is some brittleness involved in using functions to decorate methods in classes. They don't *always* compose neatly and cleanly.
