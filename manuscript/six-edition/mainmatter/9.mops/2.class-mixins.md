## Class Mixins {#class-mixins}

In [The Class Class](#classclass), we saw how we could use implementation inheritance to create [`FluentClass`](#fluentclass), a class where methods are fluent by default.

Implementation inheritance is not the only way to customize class behaviour, and it's rarely the best choice. Long experience with hierarchies of domain objects has shown that excessive reliance on implementation inheritance leads to fragile software that ends up being excessively coupled.

Contemporary thought suggests that traits or mixins are a better choice when there isn't a strong need to model an "is-a" relationship. Considering that JavaScript is a language that emphasizes ad hoc sets rather than formal classes, it makes sense to look at other ways to create classes with custom semantics.

### singleton prototypes

The typical arrangement for "classes" is that objects of the same class share a common prototype associated with the class:

This is true whether we are using functions as our "classes" or objects that are themselves instances of `Class`. In [Singleton Prototypes](#singletons), we looked at how we can associate a singleton prototype with each object:

![Singleton prototype delegation](images/singleton-prototypes.png)

Each object delegates its behaviour to its own singleton prototype, and *that* prototype delegates in turn to the class prototype. As discussed earlier, the motivation for this arrangement is so that methods can be added to individual objects while preserving a separation of domain attributes from methods. For example, you can add a method to an object's singleton prototype and still use `.hasOwnProperty()` to distinguish attributes from methods.

To create objects with singleton prototypes, we could use classes that have their own `.create` method:

    var SingletonPrototypicalClass = Class.create(Class);

    SingletonPrototypicalClass.defineMethod('create', function () {
      var singletonPrototype = Object.create(this.prototype);
      var instance = Object.create(singletonPrototype);
      Object.defineProperty(instance, 'constructor', {
        value: this
      });
      if (instance.constructor) {
        instance.constructor.apply(instance, arguments);
      }
      return instance;
    });

This "injects" the singleton prototype in between the newly created instance and the class's prototype. So if we create a new class:

    var SingletonPrototypeCell = SingletonPrototypicalClass.create();
    var SingletonPrototypeQuadTree = SingletonPrototypicalClass.create();

We know that every instance of `SingletonPrototypeCell` and `SingletonPrototypeQuadTree` will have its own singleton prototype.

### mixins

This seems very nice, but what do we do if we want a class that has both fluent interface semantics *and* singleton prototype semantics, like our `MutableQuadTree` example?

Do we decide that all classes should encompass both behaviours by adding the functionality to `Class`? That works, but it leads to a very heavyweight class system. This is the philosophy of languages like Ruby, where all classes have a lot of functionality. That is consistent with their approach to basic objects as well: The default `Object` class also has a lot of functionality that every object inherits by default.

Do we make `SingletonPrototypicalClass` a subclass of `FluentClass`? That makes it impossible to have a class with singleton prototype semantics that doesn't also have fluent semantics, and there's the little matter that fluency and prototype semantics really aren't related in any kind of "is-a" semantic sense. Making `FluentClass` a subclass of `SingletonPrototypicalClass` has the same problems.

Forty years of experience modeling domain entities has led OO thinking to the place where representing independent semantics with inheritance is now considered an anti-pattern. Instead, we look for ways to select traits, behaviours, or semantics on an a'la carte basis using template inheritance, also called *mixing in behaviour*.

Mixing behaviour in is as simple as extending the class object:

    var MutableQuadTree = Class.create();

    extend(MutableQuadTree, {
      defineMethod: function (name, body) {
        this.prototype[name] = unvariadic(body.length, function () {
          var returnValue = body.apply(this, arguments);
          if (typeof(returnValue) === 'undefined') {
            return this;
          }
          else return returnValue;
        });
        return this;
      }
    });

    extend(MutableQuadTree, {
      create: function () {
        var singletonPrototype = Object.create(this.prototype);
        var instance = Object.create(singletonPrototype);
        Object.defineProperty(instance, 'constructor', {
          value: this
        });
        if (instance.constructor) {
          instance.constructor.apply(instance, arguments);
        }
        return instance;
      }
    });

We eschew monkeying around explicitly with internals, so let's create some functions we can call:

    function Fluentize (klass) {
      extend(klass, {
        defineMethod: function (name, body) {
          this.prototype[name] = unvariadic(body.length, function () {
            var returnValue = body.apply(this, arguments);
            if (typeof(returnValue) === 'undefined') {
              return this;
            }
            else return returnValue;
          });
          return this;
        }
      });
    }

    function Singletonize (klass) {
      extend(klass, {
        create: function () {
          var singletonPrototype = Object.create(this.prototype);
          var instance = Object.create(singletonPrototype);
          Object.defineProperty(instance, 'constructor', {
            value: this
          });
          if (instance.constructor) {
            instance.constructor.apply(instance, arguments);
          }
          return instance;
        }
      });
    }

Now we can write:

    MutableQuadTree = Class.create();
    Fluentize(MutableQuadTree);
    Singletonize(MutableQuadTree);

This cleanly separates the notion of subclassing classes from the notion of some classes having traits or behaviours they share with other classes.

Note that although the mixin pattern is completely different from the subclassing `Class` pattern, both are made possible by using objects as classes rather than using functions, the `new` keyword, and directly manipulating prototypes to define methods.
