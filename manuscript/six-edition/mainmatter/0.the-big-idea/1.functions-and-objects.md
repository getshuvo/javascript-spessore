## Is JavaScript Functional or Object-Oriented? {#f-o-oo}

One of JavaScript's defining characteristics is its treatment of functions as first-class values. Like numbers, strings, and other kinds of objects, references to functions can be passed as arguments to functions, returned as the result from functions, bound to variables, and generally treated like any other value.[^reference]

[^reference]: JavaScript does not actually pass functions or any other kind of object around, it passes references to functions and other objects around. But it's awkward to describe `var I = function (a) { return a; }` as binding a reference to a function to the variable `I`, so we often take an intellectually lazy shortcut, and say the function is bound to the variable `I`. This is much the same shorthand as saying that somebody added me to the schedule for an upcoming conference: They really added my name to the list, which is a kind of reference to me.

Here's an example of passing a reference to a function around. This simple array-backed stack has an `undo` function. It works by creating a function representing the action of undoing the last update, and then pushing that onto a stack of actions to be undone:

~~~~~~~~
var stack = {
  array: [],
  undoStack: [],
  push: function (value) {
    this.undoStack.push(function () {
      this.array.pop();
    });
    return this.array.push(value);
  },
  pop: function () {
    var popped = this.array.pop();
    this.undoStack.push(function () {
      this.array.push(popped);
    });
    return popped;
  },
  isEmpty: function () {
    return array.length === 0;
  },
  undo: function () {
    this.undoStack.pop().call(this);
  }
};

stack.push('hello');
stack.push('there');
stack.push('javascript');
stack.undo();
stack.undo();
stack.pop();
  //=> 'hello'
~~~~~~~~

Functions-as-values is a powerful idea. And people often look at the idea of functions-as-values and think, "Oh, JavaScript is a functional programming language." No.

I> In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm, a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs, that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data.

I>--[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)

Functional programming might have meant "functions as first-class values" in the 1960s when Lisp was young. But time marches on, and we must march alongside it. JavaScript does not avoid state, and JavaScript embraces mutable data, so JavaScript does not value "functional programming."

### objects

JavaScript's other characteristic is its support for objects. Although JavaScript's features seem paltry compared to rich OO languages like Scala, its extreme minimalism means that you can actually build almost any OO paradigm up from basic pieces.

Now, people often hear the word "objects" and think [kingdom of nouns][kon]. But objects are not necessarily nouns, or at least, not models for obvious, tangible entities in the real world.

One example concerns [state machines][ssm]. We *could* implement a cell in [Conway's Game of Life][gol] using `if` statements and a boolean property to determine whether the cell was alive or dead:[^4r]

~~~~~~~~
var __slice = [].slice;

function extend () {
  var consumer = arguments[0],
      providers = __slice.call(arguments, 1),
      key,
      i,
      provider;

  for (i = 0; i < providers.length; ++i) {
    provider = providers[i];
    for (key in provider) {
      if (provider.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
        consumer[key] = provider[key];
      };
    };
  };
  return consumer;
};

var Universe = {
  // ...
  numberOfNeighbours: function (location) {
    // ...
  }
};

var Alive = 'alive',
    Dead  = 'dead';

var Cell = {
  numberOfNeighbours: function () {
    return Universe.numberOfNeighbours(this.location);
  },
  stateInNextGeneration: function () {
    if (this.state === Alive) {
      return (this.numberOfNeighbours() === 3)
             ? Alive
             : Dead;
    }
    else {
      return (this.numberOfNeighbours() === 2 || this.numberOfNeighbours() === 3)
             ? Alive
             : Dead;
    }
  }
};

var someCell = extend({
  state: Alive,
  location: {x: -15, y: 12}
}, Cell);
~~~~~~~~

You could say that the "state" of the cell is represented by the primitive value `'alive'` for alive, or `'dead'` for dead. But that isn't modeling the state in any way, that's just a name. The true state of the object is *implicit* in the object's behaviour, not *explicit* in the value of the `.state` property.

Here's a design where we make the state explicit instead of implicit:

~~~~~~~~
function delegateToOwn (receiver, propertyName, methods) {
  var temporaryMetaobject;

  if (methods == null) {
    temporaryMetaobject = receiver[propertyName];
    methods = Object.keys(temporaryMetaobject).filter(function (methodName) {
      return typeof(temporaryMetaobject[methodName]) === 'function';
    });
  }
  methods.forEach(function (methodName) {
    receiver[methodName] = function () {
      var metaobject = receiver[propertyName];
      return metaobject[methodName].apply(receiver, arguments);
    };
  });

  return receiver;
};

var Alive = {
  alive: function () {
    return true;
  },
  stateInNextGeneration: function () {
    return (this.numberOfNeighbours() === 3)
             ? Alive
             : Dead;
  }
};

var Dead = {
  alive: function () {
    return false;
  },
  stateInNextGeneration: function () {
    return (this.numberOfNeighbours() === 2 || this.numberOfNeighbours() === 3)
             ? Alive
             : Dead;
  }
};

var Cell = {
  numberOfNeighbours: function () {
    return thisGame.numberOfNeighbours(this.location);
  }
}

delegateToOwn(Cell, 'state', ['alive', 'stateInNextGeneration']);

var someCell = extend({
  state: Alive,
  location: {x: -15, y: 12}
}, Cell);
~~~~~~~~

In this design, `delegateToOwn` delegates the methods `.alive` and `.stateInNextGeneration` to whatever object is the value of a `Cell`'s `state` property.

So when we write `someCell.state = Alive`, then the `Alive` object will handle `someCell.alive` and `someCell.stateInNextGeneration`. And when we write `someCell.state = Dead`, then the `Dead` object will handle `someCell.alive` and `someCell.stateInNextGeneration`.

Now we've taken the implicit states of being alive or dead and transformed them into the first-class values `Alive` and `Dead`. Not a string that is used implicitly in some other code, but all of "The stuff that matters about aliveness and deadness."

This is not different than the example of passing functions around: They're both the same thing, taking something would be *implicit* in another design and/or another language, and making it *explicit*, making it a value. And making the whole thing a value, not just a boolean or a string, the complete entity.

This example is the same thing as the example of a stack that handles undo with a stack of functions: *Behaviour* is treated as a first-class value, whether it be a single function or an object with multiple methods.
