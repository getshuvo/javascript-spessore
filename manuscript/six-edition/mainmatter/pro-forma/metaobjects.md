## To Do

### templates and creation by value

### metaclasses and meta-metaobjects

### immediate, forward, and late-binding of metaobjects

### degenerate protocols

### eigenclasses, again

### prototypes vs. classes: metaobject-1s vs. metaobject-2s

### contracts and liskov equivalence

### metaobjects are not types, and types are not interfaces
