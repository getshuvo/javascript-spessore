## Records and Value Objects {#records}

Sometimes we want to share objects by reference for performance and space reasons, but we don't want them to be mutable. One motivation is when we want many objects to be able to share a common entity without worrying that one of them may inadvertently change the common entity.

JavaScript provides a way to make properties *immutable*:

~~~~~~~~
var rentAmount = {};

Object.defineProperty(rentAmount, 'dollars', {
  enumerable: true,
  writable: false,
  value: 420
});

Object.defineProperty(rentAmount, 'cents', {
  enumerable: true,
  writable: false,
  value: 0
});

rentAmount.dollars
  //=> 420


// Strict Mode:

!function () {
  "use strict"

  rentAmount.dollars = 600;
}();
  //=> TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'dollars' of #<Object>

// Beware: Non-Strict Mode

rentAmount.dollars = 600;
  //=> 600

rentAmount.dollars
  //=> 420
~~~~~~~~

`Object.defineProperty` is a general-purpose method for providing fine-grained control over the properties of any object. When we make a property `enumerable`, it shows up whenever we list the object's properties or iterate over them. When we make it writable, assignments to the property change its value. If the property isn't writable, assignments are ignored.

When we want to define multiple properties, we can also write:

~~~~~~~~
var rentAmount = {};

Object.defineProperties(rentAmount, {
  dollars: {
    enumerable: true,
    writable: false,
    value: 420
  },
  cents: {
    enumerable: true,
    writable: false,
    value: 0
  }
});

rentAmount.dollars
  //=> 420

rentAmount.dollars = 600;
  //=> 600

rentAmount.dollars
  //=> 420
~~~~~~~~

We can make properties immutable, but that doesn't prevent us from adding properties to an object:

~~~~~~~~
rentAmount.feedbackComments = []
rentAmount.feedbackComments.push("The rent is too damn high.")
rentAmount
  //=>
    { dollars: 420,
      cents: 0,
      feedbackComments: [ 'The rent is too damn high.' ] }
~~~~~~~~

Immutable properties make an object *closed for modification*. This is a separate matter from making it *closed for extension*. But we can do that too:

~~~~~~~~
Object.preventExtensions(rentAmount);

function addCurrency(amount, currency) {
  "use strict";

  amount.currency = currency;
  return currency;
}

addCurrency(rentAmount, "CAD")
  //=> TypeError: Can't add property currency, object is not extensible
~~~~~~~~

### record

Many other languages have a formal data structure that has one or more named properties that are open for modification, but closed for extension. We have named access like a dictionary, but we can't add new things will-nilly.

Old-school AI programmers call these *frames*, but most programmers are more comfortable with the term *record*. Here's a function that makes a `Record`:

~~~~~~~~
// Mutable:
function Record (template) {
  if (Record.prototype.isPrototypeOf(this)) {
    var struct = this;

    Object.keys(template).forEach(function (key) {
      Object.defineProperty(struct, key, {
        enumerable: true,
        writable: true,
        value: template[key]
      });
    });
    return Object.preventExtensions(struct);
  }
  else return new Record(template);
}

var rentAmount2 = Record({dollars: 420, cents: 0});

addCurrency(rentAmount2, "ISK");
  //=> TypeError: Can't add property currency, object is not extensible

// Immutable:
function Value (template) {

  if (Value.prototype.isPrototypeOf(this)) {
    var immutableObject = this;

    Object.keys(template).forEach(function (key) {
      Object.defineProperty(immutableObject, key, {
        enumerable: true,
        writable: false,
        value: template[key]
      });
    });
    return Object.preventExtensions(immutableObject);
  }
  else return new Value(template);
}

Value.prototype = new Record({});

function copyAmount(to, from) {
  "use strict"

  to.dollars = from.dollars;
  to.cents   = from.cents;
  return to;
}

var rentValue = Value({dollars: 1000, cents: 0});

copyAmount(rentValue, rentAmount);
  //=> TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'dollars' of #<Record>
~~~~~~~~

Records and Values are a handy way to prevent inadvertent errors and to explicitly communicate that an object is intended to be used as a struct and not as a dictionary.[^freeze]

[^freeze]: JavaScript also provides a single method that can close an object for modification, extension, and configuration at the same time: `Object.freeze(...)`.

### value objects

A dictum that we will repeat from time to time is:

> With few exceptions, a programming system cannot be improved solely by removing features that can be subject to abuse. Instead, a system is improved by removing harmful features in such a way that they enable the addition of other, more powerful features that were "blocked" by the existence of harmful features.

Our `Value` type above removes the ability to modify or extend a value. This does remove the possibility of making an accidental mistake. But does it make something else possible?

Yes.

Consider this problem:

~~~~~~~~
var juneRent = {dollars: 420, cents: 0},
    julyRent = {dollars: 420, cents: 0};

juneRent === julyRent;
	//=> false
~~~~~~~~

The june and july rents aren't `===`, because `===` performs an *object identity check* for non-primitive values. `juneRent` and `julyRent` are structurally equivalent, but not references to the same object, so they aren't `===`. No problem, let's whip up a stuctural equivalence function:

~~~~~~~~
function eqv (a, b) {
	var akeys, bkeys;

	if (a === b) {
		return true;
	}
	else if (typeof a === 'number') {
		return false;
	}
	else if (typeof a === 'boolean') {
		return false;
	}
	else if (typeof a === 'string') {
		return false;
	}
	else {
		akeys = Object.keys(a);
		bkeys = Object.keys(b);

		if (akeys.length !== bkeys.length) {
			return false;
		}
		else return akeys.every(function (key) {
			return eqv(a[key], b[key]);
		});
	}
}

eqv(juneRent, julyRent);
	//=> true
~~~~~~~~

This looks very handy. For example, if we are fetching rows of data in JSON from a server, structural equivalence is the only way to compare two rows for "equality." But there is a flaw. Note:

~~~~~~~~
eqv(juneRent, julyRent);
	//=> true

juneRent.cents = 6;
~~~~~~~~

Our test for equivalence can be broken, it only tests what was true at one moment in time. Thus, objects that are `Values` don't behave like numbers, booleans, or strings that are values. If `3 === 3`, it will always be `===`, because numbers, booleans, and strings are immutable. We can create *new* values with functions and operators, but the old ones don't change.

If we want object equivalence to mean anything, we need it to only apply to immutable objects. That sounds familiar, and thats why we called an immutable `Record` a `Value`. Let's do one more thing with it:

~~~~~~~~
(function () {

	function eqv (a, b) {
		var akeys, bkeys;

		if (a === b) {
			return true;
		}
		else if (a instanceof Value && b instanceof Value){
			akeys = Object.keys(a);
			bkeys = Object.keys(b);

			if (akeys.length !== bkeys.length) {
				return false;
			}
			else return akeys.every(function (key) {
				return eqv(a[key], b[key]);
			});
		}
		else return false;
	}

	Value.eqv = eqv;
	Value.prototype.eqv = function (that) {
		return eqv(this, that);
	};

	return Value;

})();

Value.eqv(juneRent, julyRent);
	//=> false

var juneRentValue = new Value({dollars: 420, cents: 0}),
    julyRentValue = new Value({dollars: 420, cents: 0});

Value.eqv(juneRentValue, julyRentValue);
	//=> true

juneRentValue.eqv(julyRentValue);
	//=> true
~~~~~~~~

Immutability makes structural equivalence testing meaningful, which in turn makes value objects meaningful.
