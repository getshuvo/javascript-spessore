## Templates and Prototypes {#templates}

We've already seen `extend`:

    var base = {
      all_your: 'base are belong to us'
    };

    var extended = {};

    extended.all_your
      //=> undefined

    extend(extended, base);

    extended.all_your
      //=> 'base are belong to us'

`extend` *copies* the properties from one or more objects into another. This allows us to separate behaviour from domain properties in our code. The behaviour goes in a *template* object, while the domain properties go in a *concrete* object:

    var RectangleTemplate = {
      area: function () {
        return this.length * this.width;
      }
    };

    var twoByThree = extend({
      length: 2,
      width: 3
    }, RectangleTemplate);

    twoByThree.area();
      //=> 6

As noted earlier, JavaScript is an [object-1](#object-1), so our methods are as visible as our properties when we do things like enumerate over them. Assuming that our dimensions are in meters, the following (tremendously bad) code won't work:

    var RectangleTemplate = {
      area: function () {
        return this.length * this.width;
      },
      imperialize: function () {
        for (var dimension in this) {
          this[dimension] = this[dimension] * 3.281;
        }
        return this;
      }
    };

    var twoByThree = extend({
      length: 2,
      width: 3
    }, RectangleTemplate);

    twoByThree.imperialize().area()
      //=> TypeError: Property 'area' of object #<Object> is not a function

What went wrong?

    twoByThree
      //=>
        { length: 6.562,
          width: 9.843,
          area: NaN,
          imperialize: NaN }

Our methods were enumerated alongside our domain properties. We learned earlier that we can use `Object.defineProperty` to make them non-enumerable. Let's rewrite `extend` to make everything in our template non-enumerable:

    var naiveExtendWithTemplates = variadic( function (concrete, templates) {
      var key,
          i,
          template;

      for (i = 0; i < templates.length; ++i) {
        template = templates[i];
        for (key in template) {
          if (template.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
            Object.defineProperty(concrete, key, {
              writable: true,
              enumerable: false,
              value: template[key]
            });
          }
        }
      }
      return concrete;
    });

Let's try it now:

    var RectangleTemplate = {
      area: function () {
        return this.length * this.width;
      },
      imperialize: function () {
        for (var dimension in this) {
          this[dimension] = this[dimension] * 3.281;
        }
        return this;
      }
    };

    var twoByThree = naiveExtendWithTemplates({
      length: 2,
      width: 3
    }, RectangleTemplate);

    twoByThree.imperialize().area()
      //=> 64.589766

    twoByThree
      //=> { length: 6.562, width: 9.843 }

### this does not commute

One problem with our first cut is that you cannot use `naiveExtendWithTemplates` to make a template out of a template:

    var SquareAwareTemplate = naiveExtendWithTemplates({
      isaSquare: function () {
        return this.length === this.width;
      }
    }, RectangleTemplate);

    var fourByFour = naiveExtendWithTemplates({
      length: 4,
      width: 4
    }, SquareAwareTemplate);

    fourByFour.area()
      //=> TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'area'

The problem arises from the fact that we iterate over properties in the template, so we are only looking at *enumerable* properties. But when we copy properties from `RectangleTemplate` into `SquareAwareTemplate`, we made the `RectangleTemplate` properties non-enumerable.

So we need to change things such that we get all the properties, including the non-enumerable ones:

    var extendWithTemplates = variadic( function (concrete, templates) {
      var key,
          i,
          template;

      for (i = 0; i < templates.length; ++i) {
        template = templates[i];
        Object.getOwnPropertyNames(template).forEach(function (key) {
          Object.defineProperty(concrete, key, {
            writable: true,
            enumerable: false,
            value: template[key]
          });
        });
      }
      return concrete;
    });

Let's try it again:

    var SquareAwareTemplate = extendWithTemplates({
      isaSquare: function () {
        return this.length === this.width;
      }
    }, RectangleTemplate);

    var fourByFour = extendWithTemplates({
      length: 4,
      width: 4
    }, SquareAwareTemplate);

    fourByFour.area()
      //=> 16

### prototypes

JavaScript does not normally use templates to separate behaviour, especially shared behaviour, from domain properties. Instead, it uses prototypes. Our example with prototypes, `Object.create` and `extend` looks like this:

    var RectanglePrototype = extend(Object.create(null), {
      area: function () {
        return this.length * this.width;
      },
      imperialize: function () {
        for (var dimension in this) {
          this[dimension] = this[dimension] * 3.281;
        }
        return this;
      }
    });

    var SquareAwarePrototype = extend(Object.create(RectanglePrototype), {
      isaSquare: function () {
        return this.length === this.width;
      }
    });

    var fourByFour = extend(Object.create(SquareAwarePrototype), {
      length: 4,
      width: 4
    });

In each case, we're creating a new, empty object and copying our properties into it with `extend`. Thanks to the prototype chain:

    fourByFour.area()
      //=> 16
    fourByFour.isaSquare()
      //=> true
    fourByFour
      //=> { length: 4, width: 4 }

### templates vs prototypes

So why use templates instead of prototypes? Or rather, when would it be appropriate? This is a poignant question, especially since prototypes are the most common way to separate behaviour from domain responsibilities in JavaScript.

The decision comes down to this observation: Templates share via shallow copying, prototypes share via reference. This means that changes to a template do *not* propagate after-the-fact:

    var RectangleTemplate = {
      area: function () {
        return this.length * this.width;
      },
      imperialize: function () {
        for (var dimension in this) {
          this[dimension] = this[dimension] * 3.281;
        }
        return this;
      }
    };

    var fourByFour = extendWithTemplates({
      length: 4,
      width: 4
    }, RectangleTemplate);

    RectangleTemplate.isaSquare = function () {
      return this.length === this.width;
    };

    fourByFour.isaSquare()
      //=> TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'isaSquare'

Whereas:

    var RectanglePrototype = extend(Object.create(null), {
      area: function () {
        return this.length * this.width;
      },
      imperialize: function () {
        for (var dimension in this) {
          this[dimension] = this[dimension] * 3.281;
        }
        return this;
      }
    });

    var fourByFour = extend(Object.create(RectanglePrototype), {
      length: 4,
      width: 4
    });

    RectanglePrototype.isaSquare = function () {
      return this.length === this.width;
    };

    fourByFour.isaSquare()
      //=> true

Making changes to a prototype *after* we create objects with that prototype has the effect of changing the behaviour of those objects. Usually, that's exactly what we want: As a rule of thumb, *we prefer late-binding to early-binding*.

I> Prototypes aren't *always* superior to templates, so we should keep our minds open. JavaScript's prototypes were inspired by the language [Self]. Self has prototypes, but they are copied like our templates rather than maintaining references. Designers David Ungar and Randall Smith had been working with large Smalltalk applications, and one of their concerns was that large hierarchies of classes became very fragile: Changes to classes would ripple through the system, making it very hard to refactor. Switching to prototypes that were copied like templates made it easier to handle changes to the code.

[Self]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_(programming_language)

Prototypes have a limitation. Consider how we extend the behaviour of an object with as many templates as we like:

    var RectangleTemplate...
    var LineDrawing...

    var fourByFour = extendWithTemplates(..., RectangleTemplate, LineDrawing);

You can extend the behaviour of an object as much as you want when you're copying functions and properties from templates. Whereas, each object can only have one prototype.

If prototypes were the only way to represent behaviour common to more than one object, this would limit our ability to express common behaviour. For example:

- Alice and Charlie both play football.
- Bob and Charlie both scuba dive.

We could easily write:

    var FootballPlayer = { ... };
    var ScubaDiver = { ... };

    var Alice = Object.create(FootballPlayer);
    var Bob   = Object.create(ScubaDiver);

But what do we do with Charlie? There is no way that Charlie can delegate behaviour to *both* `FootballPlayer` *and* `ScubaDiver` using prototypes.

Using $2 words, we say that "Templates model behaviour as Directed Acyclic Graphs ("DAGs"), whereas prototypes model behaviour as Strict Trees." Every tree is a DAG, but most DAGs are not trees, thus we infer that there are things we can model with templates that we cannot model with prototypes.
